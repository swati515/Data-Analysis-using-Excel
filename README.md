Flipkartâ€™s customer service operations report
(Impact of customer service on customer retention) 

The purpose of this analysis is to understand the impact of customer service on customer
retention at Flipkart. The goal of this analysis is to uncover specific issues exclusively within
customer service operations that may be affecting customer satisfaction which ultimately leads to
decline in customer retention. So, we will focus on analysing customer call data and will examine
key metrics, including customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores and service performance across
various call centres and support channels to determine if and how it impacts customer retention.
The goal is to improve customer retention by analysing customer service operations at Flipkart.
